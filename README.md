Task 1 â€“ Netflix Titles Dashboard | Data Science Internship

ðŸ“Œ Task Objective
Visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables.
I extended this task by creating an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Netflix dataset.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features
Bar Chart â€“ Distribution of Ratings (categorical variable)
Histogram â€“ Distribution of Duration in Minutes (continuous variable)
Stacked Histogram â€“ Release Year trends split by Country (categorical + continuous combo)

ðŸ›  Tools Used
Tableau Public â€“ for visualization
Netflix Titles Dataset (Kaggle) â€“ for analysis

ðŸŽ¯ Learnings
Understood the importance of choosing the right chart for categorical vs continuous data
Learned how to clean & transform text fields (e.g., converting Duration into numeric minutes)
Built multiple worksheets and combined them into a single dashboard
Explored how country-level filters change trends across release years
